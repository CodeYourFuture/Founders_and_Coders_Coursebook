## Debugging JavaScript

How would you effectively find out where (and why) an error is occurring in your JavaScript code?

### Questions to consider

1. What `console` methods are there other than `console.log`? Can these help us debug?
1. What does the `debugger;` statement do?
1. How do we use the debugger in our browser?

## Debugging network requests

How can we send and receive test network requests while working on an application?

### Questions to consider

1. How can we inspect any requests the browser is making on an HTML page?
1. How can we manually send test requests outside of our browser?

## Asynchronous JavaScript

How does JS handle asynchronous code? (Note: this does **not** refer to [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)).

### Questions to consider

1. What do we mean by "asynchronous code"? What is "blocking code"?
1. What are the event loop and the call stack?
1. How do callbacks and promises help us?
