## How do I edit my user manual?
Your manuals are all in your cohort's repo as issues. Click on the 'issues' tab to see them all.
Create your own, and when you need to edit it in the future you can click the `...` in the top right of the comment to update your info.
We will make time regularly to go back and edit this, so don't worry if you can't think of wildly exciting things to write about. Fill in what you can and treat this more as a live document that you will shape as the course develops.

## Why are we doing this?
It's a great way to think about ourselves and how we work in a team. It's also a great way to find out about our team-mates before working together so we know how to get the best out of each other and work well as a team ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬
