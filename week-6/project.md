# The Project

Your challenge for the next couple of days is to build a site that lets logged in users submit blog posts.

Weâ€™re expecting to see:

- A form where users can log in to authenticate themselves
- A form where the user can submit their blog post data
- A list of all the blog posts
- A page showing a specific post
- The server should persist blog post data to the DB and associate each with a user
- The submission page should only be available to authenticated users
- Only the authenticated author of a post should be allowed to delete it

## Stretch goals

- An author page with all the posts by an author
