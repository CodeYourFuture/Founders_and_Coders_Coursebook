## Installation List

For OSX Users:

- Install [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
- Optional: iTerm2

For Linux Users:  

| Distro        | Base           | Package Manager | 
|-------------|-------------|-----  
| [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) | [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) | [APT](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) | 
| [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) | [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) | [APT](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) |  

- Ubuntu and Linux Mint are probably the two most used desktop Linux distros out there. Mint is becoming increasingly popular and in a lot of ways, is more beginner-friendly than Ubuntu. It also uses up less memory resource (the most lightweight Mint edition is XFCE), and will be better suited to slower machines.

For Windows Users:

You **must** install Linux. Without dual booting Linux, you will encounter problems when we begin database week. In the past, this has led to students missing whole days of workshops while they troubleshoot. 

- To dual boot, there are a lot of articles online about dualbooting windows + linux, and due to a lot of different OS configurations you may be best off searching google for your specific OS + Ubuntu (eg: "dual boot windows 10 and Ubuntu"). However here are some links that may be useful

- [How to install Ubuntu 18.04 alongside Windows 10](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031993/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-alongside-windows-10) - useful at time of posting (mid 2018)
- [Dual boot Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/214571/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-pc/) 
- We shall have a couple of FAC students and alumni available at the installation party to guide you through installing linux. Please come along if you have Windows OS. 
- Finally please do not hesistate to come to a meetup or contact us on slack if you are having trouble, we can help!

Chromebook Users:

- Chromebooks [all now officially run Linux](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/all-chromebooks-will-now-be-linux-ready) and [setting it up on older machines](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en-GB) is pretty simple, too.

For Everyone:

- Install and manage Node.js using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  
Note: We will be covering Node.js during the course. If you are curious and would like some background reading, [Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node) is a great resource.
- Install a text editor of your choice. We reccommend either: 
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Chrome
- [Setup SSH access to your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)
- Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Chrome extensions:
  - JSONView
- Make sure to explore your editors plugin ecosystem for useful plugins:
  - [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode)
  - [Atom packages](https://atom.io/packages)
  - ...but don't be overwhelmed, you don't _need_ to install anything further
