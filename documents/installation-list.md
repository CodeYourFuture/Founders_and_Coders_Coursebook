# Installation List

## For OSX Users:

- Install [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
- Optional: iTerm2

## For Linux Users:  

| Distro        | Base           | Package Manager | 
|-------------|-------------|-----  
| [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) | [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) | [APT](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) | 
| [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) | [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) | [APT](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) |  

- Ubuntu and Linux Mint are probably the two most used desktop Linux distros out there. Mint is becoming increasingly popular and in a lot of ways, is more beginner-friendly than Ubuntu. It also uses up less memory resource (the most lightweight Mint edition is XFCE), and will be better suited to slower machines.

## For Windows Users:

- For the course you'll **need** to install a Linux operating system on your machine and dual boot - students in the past who have tried to use Windows always encounter big setbacks with installation problems and general incompatibility issues.
- It's not as scary as it sounds! There are a lot of articles online to help you. Due to a lot of different OS configurations you may be best off searching google for your specific OS + distro (eg: "dual boot windows 10 and Ubuntu"). However here are some links that may be useful:

- [How to install Ubuntu 18.04 alongside Windows 10](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031993/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-alongside-windows-10) - useful at time of posting (mid 2018)
- [Dual boot Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/214571/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-pc/) 
- We shall have a couple of FAC students and alumni available at the installation party to guide you through installing linux. Please come along if you have Windows OS.
- This [Lifewire article](https://www.lifewire.com/beginners-guide-to-linux-4090233) is informative and accessible, and [this PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2918397/how-to-get-started-with-linux-a-beginners-guide.html) has more info on installing Linux.
- Dual boot [Windows 10 + Linux Mint](https://itsfoss.com/guide-install-linux-mint-16-dual-boot-windows/), and [Windows 10 + Ubuntu](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)
- Some extra info on [APT](https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/), the command-line tool for the Debian packaging system.
- Finally please do not hesistate to come to a meetup or contact us on slack if you are having trouble, we can help!

## Chromebook Users:

- Chromebooks [all now officially run Linux](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/all-chromebooks-will-now-be-linux-ready) and [setting it up on older machines](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en-GB) is pretty simple, too.

## For Everyone:

- Install and manage Node.js using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  
Note: We will be covering Node.js during the course. If you are curious and would like some background reading, [Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node) is a great resource.
- Install a text editor of your choice. We reccommend either: 
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - because of it's source control and liveShare features
- Install Chrome
- [Setup SSH access to your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)
- Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Chrome extensions:
  - JSONView
- Make sure to explore your editors plugin ecosystem for useful plugins:
  - [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) - we recommend prettier and Rainbow Brackets
  - ...but don't be overwhelmed, you don't _need_ to install anything further
