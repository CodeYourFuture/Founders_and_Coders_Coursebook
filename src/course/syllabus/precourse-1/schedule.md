## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](/course/handbook/installation).

## Terminal

Work through [Digital Ocean's Command Line Primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer). It says it's for Linux but it's applicable for Macs and Windows if you're using something like WSL or Git Bash.

Practice using your Terminal to navigate your computer for the other tasks this week.

## HTML

Work through the [Semantic HTML workshop](/workshops/semantic-html/) to practice using more descriptive elements rather than divs and spans.

## A11y

Work through the [Learn Accessibility workshop](/workshops/learn-a11y/) to practice building sites for everyone.

## Git/GitHub

Fork [this repository](https://github.com/fac22/project-collection) to your own profile and commit something each day. This will be a directory of the sites you create during the pre-apprenticeship and a record of your learnings.

Customise the site in your own way and add your own style to it.

Practice working with git and GitHub by pushing your solution to the HTML workshop to this repository.

## Markdown

Read [GitHub's Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` for your learning repository. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

This should explain what you learnt, anything interesting you wanted to share etc.

## Execute Program

Work on [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) every day. Start with the Modern JavaScript and Arrays sections.

## Projects

Sign up for [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) and work on the first two projects:

- JavaScript Drum Kit
- CSS + JS Clock

Focus on using Semantic HTML and ensuring the site has 100% in a Lighthouse Accessibility audit.

Add the websites into your project collection as well as some notes on what you've learnt while building them.
