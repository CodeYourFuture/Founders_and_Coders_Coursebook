## Terminal

Work through [Digital Ocean's Command Line Primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer). It says it's for Linux but it's applicable for Macs and Windows if you're using something like WSL or Git Bash.

Practice using your Terminal to navigate your computer for the other tasks this week.

## HTML

Work through the [Semantic HTML workshop](/workshops/semantic-html/) to practice using more descriptive elements rather than divs and spans.

## Git/GitHub

Practice working with git and GitHub by pushing your solution to the HTML workshop to the FAC21 repository.

## Markdown

Read [GitHub's Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` for your workshop solution. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

This should explain what you learnt, anything interesting you wanted to share etc. We'll use this as the basis for our group discussion in the next session.
