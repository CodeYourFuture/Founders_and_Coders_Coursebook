Your project for the next two weeks is to build a _Projects Gallery_ using what you've learnt. The gallery should have an image of the project, a title and a short description.

Create an `index.html` in your existing learnings repo on GitHub. You can create the gallery in here, with links to all the projects in the repo, and then deploy the repo to GitHub Pages.

See [resources](../resources) for a list of helpful resources in building this. Use your learnings from this week's workshop and any relevant material outlined in the [schedule](../schedule)
