Your project for the next two weeks is to build a _Projects Gallery_ using what you've learnt. The gallery should have an image of the project, a title and a short description.

Add this to your learning site, either directly or via a link.

See [resources](../resources) for a list of helpful resources in building this. Use your learnings from this week's workshop and any relevant material outlined in the [schedule](../schedule)
