## CSS Layouts

This week, we looked at [CSS Layouts](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/css-layout/).

For next week, focus on building a [projects gallery](../project).

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid offers two-dimensional layouts for our pages. We define a series of rows and columns and fit our content inside these.

Work through [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) for an interactive introduction to grids.

Have a go at [recreating a BBC News style homepage](https://github.com/bobbysebolao/learn-css-grid) using CSS Grid.

## A11y

Look into [ARIA Labels](https://css-tricks.com/why-how-and-when-to-use-semantic-html-and-aria/) and learn [why they're used](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/what-a-year-of-learning-and-teaching-accessibility-taught-me/). Include them in your project for these two weeks.

## Git and GitHub
