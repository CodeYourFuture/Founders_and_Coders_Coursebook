## CSS

1. Work through [Learn Layout](https://learnlayout.com/), a great intro to different kinds of CSS layout.
1. Work through our [CSS Layout](/workshops/css-layout/) workshop. This teaches you how to structure your CSS as primitive "layout components".

## Git/GitHub

Practice working with git and GitHub by pushing your solution to the CSS workshop to the [FAC21 pre-course repository](https://github.com/fac21/pre-course/).

## Markdown

Read [GitHub's Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` for your workshop solution. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

This should explain what you learnt, anything interesting you wanted to share etc. We'll use this as the basis for our group discussion in the next session.
