## Git/GitHub

Practice working with git and GitHub by pushing your solution to the CSS workshop to the [FAC21 pre-course repository](https://github.com/fac21/pre-course/).

Make sure you create a new folder with your name inside the `css-layout` folder. You can put your solution in there.

Don't forget to practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` documenting your learnings this week.
