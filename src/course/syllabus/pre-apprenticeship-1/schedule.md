## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](/course/handbook/installation).

If you get stuck, ask in Discord for help.

## Terminal

Work through [Digital Ocean's Command Line Primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer). It says it's for Linux but it's applicable for Macs and Windows if you're using something like WSL or Git Bash.

Practice using your Terminal to navigate your computer for the other tasks this week.

## HTML

Work through the [Semantic HTML workshop](/workshops/semantic-html/) to practice using more descriptive elements rather than divs and spans.

## A11y

Work through the [Learn Accessibility workshop](/workshops/learn-a11y/) to practice building sites for everyone.

## Projects

Sign up for [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) and work on the first two projects:

- JavaScript Drum Kit
- CSS + JS Clock

Focus on using Semantic HTML, ensuring the sites have 100% in a Lighthouse Accessibility audit, and manually testing the accessibility.

Add the websites into your project collection as well as some notes on what you've learnt while building them.

## Git/GitHub

Have a look at the structure of [this repository](https://github.com/fac22/project-collection) and create your own version on your own profile.

This will become a directory of all the sites you create during the pre-apprenticeship and a record of your learnings.

Customise the site in your own way and add your own style to it.

Practice working with git and GitHub by pushing your workshop solutions and projects to this repository.

For now, stick with a simple structure - GitHub pages supports rending a README from the root directory. Throughout the programme aim to commit something every working day to iteratively build your site.

## Markdown

Read [GitHub's Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` for your learning repository. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

This should explain what you've been learning, anything interesting you wanted to share etc.

## Execute Program

Work on [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) every day. Start with the **Modern JavaScript** and **Arrays** sections.

## Employment

### Get active on Twitter

Please post your Twitter handle on Discord, so that we can all follow you.

### Research homework

Look into how to implement ES6 array methods, like map, reduce, filter and forEach, using just a for-loop. Choose one as a challenge for next week in the role of coach.

### Search for “Jackson Gabbard”

Find his blog and YouTube channel and spend some time with them.

### _Optional homework_

Attempt to create a script that generates 11 combinations of 4 groups of 3 people, so that any two people share the same group exactly twice and no three people are in the same group more than once. No group should be majoritively male. (I haven’t checked if this is a solvable problem yet, so please don’t spend too much time on it). Please don't post your solutions until this time next week, to give everyone who wants to have a go at it a bit of time.
