Your project is to build a fruit shop that lists fruits and allows a user to create a shopping basket. The user can add and remove items from the basket, and can see the contents of their basket on the page.

## Requirements

- [ ] Display fruits available for purchase
- [ ] Have a working _add to basket_ button for each fruit
- [ ] Store the user's basket as a JavaScript object
- [ ] Have buttons to add one, remove one, and remove all instances of a fruit in the basket
- [ ] Increment or decrement the object values when fruits are added or removed
- [ ] Use reusable functions to complete repeated tasks
- [ ] Display the quantity of each fruit in the basket, when there is at least one of any fruit
- [ ] Display the basket as empty if all object values are zero
- [ ] Show a total number of fruits in the basket

For this project, we'd like you to get used to using Git from your terminal.

The terminal (sometimes known as the command line) is an interface you can use to navigate file structure, install software, and many other things. It can take a little while to get used to, but can prove much faster than using a GUI. If you're unfamiliar, we'd recommend having a look at [Josh W Comeau's introduction](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/).

The steps in using Git are the same you learn in [our first workshop](/workshops/git-intro) - however, we'd encourage you to follow through [our second workshop](/workshops/git-terminal) to get up to speed.
