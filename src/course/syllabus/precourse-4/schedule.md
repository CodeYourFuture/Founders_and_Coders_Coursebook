## Mini-project

You're going to be building a small project this week: a "[Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer". This is a productivity tool that helps you time alternating periods of working and resting.

### Features

- A "work" timer that counts down to zero (usually 25 minutes)
- A second "break" timer that counts down to zero (usually 5 minutes)
- Buttons to start a session, pause the timer, or cancel the session and restart

### Stretch goals

- Customisable lengths of time for work/break
- Play an alarm sound to make it obvious the time is up

### Publishing

Create a new GitHub repo for your project within the FAC21 organisation. E.g. `fac21/oliverjam-timer`.

Don't forget to practice your Markdown by writing a `README.md` documenting the process you went through building this. Try to record what you got stuck on, what you found interesting, new things you learnt etc.
