# Design Week Spikes

This week, spikes will be in your role groups. At the start of the spike, reach out to your role mentor for advice on what to focus on. Take a look at our suggestions below for inspiration. Use this as an opportunity to read and explore documentation on a new technology or practice

## Groups

Within your role groups you might like to do your research as a four or in two separate pairs. If you decide to pair up then we suggest that you split the presentation time into equal halves. You should not work indivudally on a spike.

## DevOps

For DevOps we recommend you look into staging environments. In real world apps there will usually be a staging and production environment and sometimes a testing environment. Look into setting up and maintaining these separate environments.

## QA

QA's might like to focus on testing in GitHub Action CI. You might like to look at a new testing framework that we haven't covered on the course.

## UX

For the UX role, you might like to look at styling methodologies or a particular methodology such as Styled Components.

## Scrum

Scrum should focus on learning techniques or processes to make working together a smooth process. You might like to look at techniques for time estimations, such as PERT Estimation Technique.
