Your project this week is to build anything you like as long as it meets the technical criteria below. It should still be a Node/Express server-rendered application with a Postgres database, but feel free to get creative with the ideas.

This week is the culmination of your Express learning, so focus on doing everything as professionally as you can. Your app should have validation, error-handling, good user-experience etc.

## Technical spikes

Your project should include at least one of these [new topics](../spikes). You'll have to spend some time researching them in your group, figuring out how exactly to implement them before you start working on your project. There are minimal examples provided, but they are only one way to approach itâ€”you should look for tutorials/blog posts etc with alternative solutions and find one you like.

## Technical criteria

- Express server
- Well-organised modular codebase
- Postgres database
- Hosted on Heroku
- One of the [spike topics](../spikes)
- Validate user-submitted data on the server
- Handle errors and inform the user
- Styled appropriately
