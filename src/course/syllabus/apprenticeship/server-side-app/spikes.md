## Session flash messages

Show temporary messages after successful/failed form submissions to help the user understand what's happening. Note that this is a little complex to manage on your own: you may want to use a session middleware library from npm.

## Sending emails

Send emails from your server for notifying the user. E.g. sign up success, to verify email addresses or reset passwords.
**Important:** since spam is a huge problem with email all email-sending services (like Mailgun or Sendgrid) require a credit card/your real address. Bear this in mind before you choose this option!
