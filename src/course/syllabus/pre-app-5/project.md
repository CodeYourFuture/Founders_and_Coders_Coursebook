Your project for this week is to continue working on your [digital agency website](../../pre-app-4/project).

This week you'll work together to add user submissions as elements on your site. They does not need to be preserved on refresh.

Use what you've learnt in this week's DOM workshops to code an efficient solution.

Your comments section should:

- Attach a user name to each comment
- Allow users to leave comments requesting to work with your agency
- Limit the length of comments to 149 characters

### User Stories

## User Stories

_**A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.**_

### Core Stories

Together, you and your partner should decide who will lead on each user story. You may need to rely on each other for parts of the project. Try to split the work evenly between you both.

**As a potential client, I want to:**

- Input my name, email address and a description of the job to complete (E1)
- Be notified if my email address doesn't look right (E2)
- Be notified if the content I'm writing is too long (E2)
- See my comment on the page once I click a button (E3)
- Click a button to remove a comment (E3)

**Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:**

- Navigate your website using keyboard controls (E2)
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website (E1)

## Acceptance Criteria

_**User stories come with [acceptance criteria](https://blog.easyagile.com/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development-d4b25356b604?gi=dc603f56ed77) - a detailed scope of a user’s requirements.**_

- Navigation menu
- ‘About us’ section
- Contact form
- A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

### Stretch Goal

Use the automatic trigger functionality of your [GitHub project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).
