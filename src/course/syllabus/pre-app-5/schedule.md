## GitHub

Upload your learnings from this week onto your learning repository.

Now that you've code reviewed someone else's code, you might like to refactor your own site. Consider the architecture of the site and what you want the focus of the site to be.

You're welcome to pair up and review one another sites too.

## Project

Continue working on your site in pairs. Have a look at the [new User Stories](../project) and work on them this week.

## Execute Program

Keep up with your daily practice on Execute Program.

## JavaScript30

Continue working on JavaScript30 Projects. We suggest taking a look at these two:

- JS30: Object and Arrays - Reference VS Copy
- JS30: Sorting Band Names without articles

## Spikes

This week, there is one [tech spike on Advanced DOM](../spikes).
