This topic is focused on working together effectively using Git and GitHub. Since it's your first week as a cohort it'll include some introductory material from the core team as well.

## Week 1

1. [Command-line primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer) (1h)

   Digital Ocean's Command Line Primer is a great intro to using your terminal. It says it's for Linux but it's applicable for Macs and Windows if you're using something like WSL or Git Bash.

   Try to practice using your Terminal to navigate your computer as you're working on other tasks.

1. [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (0.5h)

   GitHub's Markdown introduction introduces using the Markdown language to quickly write simple HTML. Practice your Markdown by writing `README.md` files for your GitHub repositories. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

1. [Git workflow](/workshops/git-workflow/) (2h)

   Learn how to collaborate on a project using Git and GitHub, including using pull requests.
