# Product pitches & Selection

- The product owners would send in a short video product pitch that collates all the information from the previous weeks to give a comprehensive summary of the product and why the devs should consider it.

- The devs would then have a discussion about the diffrent product pitches and express their prefrences for the one they want to work on.
