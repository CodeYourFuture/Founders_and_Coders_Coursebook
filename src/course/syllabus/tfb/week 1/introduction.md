# Introduction

Have the product owners fill out a Miro template of what their ideas are, who they're for (the user group) and how developing an app will fix the issue they are currently facing. Ahead of them starting the programme, this can then be discussed between the Devs and the PO's during the session and will inform what they find during the Discovery Workshop.

## What is the Tech for Better programme?

The **"Tech for Better"** programme teaches **Product Management** to social entrepreneurs, charities and start-ups through a hands-on experience.

## What is Product Managment?

_"Project management is the art of getting things done... Product management is the art of deciding what to do in the first place"_- Jennifer Pahlka, author of Recoding America, on [The Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jennifer-pahlka.html)

Meanwhile, **Product ownership** is the **art of balancing the needs of users with your team's capabilities.**

**Product managers** need to be good at all three.

## How is the programme structured?

The programme will allow you to work with your Product Owners over several weeks exploring and dveloping their ideas.

This how the next few weeks will look:

## What happens after the Product Management Phase?

After selecting the projects you want to work on you go and build a MVP using your figma prototype as a blueprint. You will also be collaborating with your Product Owners throughout the process.

## What will you do in this session?

- Sit down with a different pair of devs and discuss your idea (10 minutes each)
- Define a problem statement (10 minutes)
- Create user personas (15 minutes)
- Formulate questions that could be asked to the users (35 minutes)
- Use the questions from the previous step to create a user research script (20 minutes)
