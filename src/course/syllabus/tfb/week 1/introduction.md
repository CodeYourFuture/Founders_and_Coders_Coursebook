# Introduction

Have the product owners fill out a Miro template of what their ideas are, who they're for (the user group) and how developing an app will fix the issue they are currently facing. Ahead of them starting the programme, this can then be discussed between the Devs and the PO's during the session and will inform what they find during the Discovery Workshop.
