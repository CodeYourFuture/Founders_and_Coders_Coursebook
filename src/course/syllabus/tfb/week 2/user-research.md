# User research

## An Intro to research

Validating an idea with a user group is an important part of software development

Feedback from your users will be analysed and inform the direction of the Product

## Qualitative vs Quantitative

There are two main avenues to analysing results from testing:

- Qualitative
- Quantitative

**Qualitative research** seeks to understand subjective experiences and perspectives through non-numerical data.

**Quantitative research** uses numerical data to analyze relationships and draw objective conclusions.

## Things to remember when conducting Research

- Always introduce yourself and give context. WHAT are you conducting research for? WHY are you conducting research? HOW will their feedback help?
- Try NOT to ask leading questions! e.g. "Do you agree that our app is the most user-friendly and efficient solution in the market?"
- Try to keep your questions open-ended. e.g. "On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is very unlikely and 10 is very likely, How likely are you to take a recommendation for a film from a friend"
- It's OK to go off script and ask questions that go with the flow of the conversation.
- Remember to thank users for their time.
