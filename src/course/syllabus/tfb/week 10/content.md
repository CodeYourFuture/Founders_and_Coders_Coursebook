## What is usability testing?

Usability testing is where you and your product owners present your clickable Figma Prototype to users. The aim of usability testing is to understand how a user interacts with the app and what features could be changed to make the user journey better.

Feedback from your users will be analysed and will inform how you iterate over your protoype next week.

## How will the session work?

The **Product Owner will lead the session** and will be asking the users questions and giving them tasks to complete. As discussed in the scripting stage last week.

The **Developers will observe the users journey** and make note of:

- Tasks the user completed
- Tasks the user struggled with
- Tasks the user was not able to complete
- Observations about the look of the app
- Observations about the functionality of the app
- Observations about the feel of the app
- Any other observations.

After 2 hours you should have oservations from 5-6 different users, you can then use **TRAFFIC LIGHT ANALYSIS** and **RAINBOW CHART ANALYSIS**, which we mention last week. This will help you get a better understanding of features or pages that need to be changed.

## Things to remember when conducting testing.

- Always introduce yourself and give context. WHAT is the app? WHAT is it's purpose? HOW will their feedback help?
- **Try NOT to ask leading questions!** e.g. "Would you use this app if it came to market, if not, why not?"
- Try to keep your questions open-ended. e.g. "What experience do you have of using an app that...[function of the app]?"
- It's OK to go off script and ask questions that go with the flow of the conversation.
- **Encourage them to think out loud**.
- Give users time to **work out things for themselves** before jumping in to help them out.
- Remember to thank users for their time.
