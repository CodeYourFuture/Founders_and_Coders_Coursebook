# Research Analysis & Definition (150 minutes)

## How do we conduct research analysis?

Research analysis is split into 3 - 15 minute sessions:

1. **SUMMARISE** the notes your product owner shares with you from their user research.
2. **REFLECT** on themes that summarise the notes from the first step.
3. **ANALYSE** the themes from the second step and ask "What does this mean?"

## Definition

Definition focuses on moving from an idea to something we can prototype. It is broken down into a number of exercises:

1. **INSPIRATIONS** - Draw from other sources (websites, mobile phone apps etc) to get an idea of what we might include in the app.
2. **LIGHTNING TALKS** - Discuss, with your team, your rationale for the screens you have chosen from the previous step.
3. **CRAZY EIGHTS** - Draw 8 lightning sketches in 8 minutes, 1 minute for each drawing.
4. **UPLOAD** - Take some time to upload your designs onto your miro board.
5. **LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMES** - Take a few of the screens from the _Crazy Eights_ step and recreate them as screens on Miro.
6. **DOT VOTE** - Mark what draws your attention or interest on Miro.
7. **DISCUSS** - Come together to discuss what youâ€™ve created and what to move forward with.
