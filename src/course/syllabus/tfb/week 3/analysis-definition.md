# Research Analysis & Definition (2.5 Hours)

## How do we conduct research analysis?

Research analysis is split into 3 - 15 minute sessions:

1. **SUMMARISE** the notes your product owner shares with you from their user research.
2. **REFLECT** on themes that summarise the notes from the first step.
3. **ANALYSE** the themes from the second step and ask "What does this mean?"
