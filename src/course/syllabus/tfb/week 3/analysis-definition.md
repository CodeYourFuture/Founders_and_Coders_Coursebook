# Research Analysis & Definition (2.5 Hours)

## How do we conduct research analysis?

Research analysis is split into 3 - 15 minute sessions:

1. **SUMMARISE** the notes your product owner shares with you from their user research.
2. **REFLECT** on themes that summarise the notes from the first step.
3. **ANALYSE** the themes from the second step and ask "What does this mean?"

## Product Management

Product management is a 30 minute exercise where you will:

1. **DEFINE** multiple user stories in the _As a... I want to... So that I can..._ format. This should reflect the granular tasks the user should be able to complete when using the app.
2. **PRIORITISE** each user story with your product owner. The user stories that are HIGH priority will be your minimum viable product (MVP) everything else could be a stretch goal.
3. **ESTIMATE** how easy or difficult you believe that user story will be to complete and attach a number to it.

## Definition

Definition focuses on moving from an idea to something we can prototype. It is broken down into a number of exercises:

1. **INSPIRATIONS** - Draw from other sources (websites, mobile phone apps etc) to get an idea of what we might include in the app.
2. **LIGHTNING TALKS** - Discuss, with your team, your rationale for the screens you have chosen from the previous step.
3. **CRAZY EIGHTS** - Draw 8 lightning sketches in 8 minutes, 1 minute for each drawing.
4. **UPLOAD** - Take some time to upload your designs onto your miro board.
5. **LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMES** - Take a few of the screens from the _Crazy Eights_ step and recreate them as screens on Miro.
6. **DOT VOTE** - Mark what draws your attention or interest on Miro.
7. **DISCUSS** - Come together to discuss what youâ€™ve created and what to move forward with.
