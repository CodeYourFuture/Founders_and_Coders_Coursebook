# Figma Workshop 2

## What will we be doing in this session?

- Product owners should have given comments to the Devs before this sessions

- Devs spend the first 75 minutes iterating over their Figma prototype using the feedback from the PO's

- Add in information from the Usability testing slide deck.

- Add in information about the two types of analysis, Traffic Light and Rainbow so that they can ask questions that help them analyse their feedback better.

- Write out a usability testing script for the Product owner to use the following week. (30 mins)
