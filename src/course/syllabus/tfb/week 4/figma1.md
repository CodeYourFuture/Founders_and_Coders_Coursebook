# Figma Workshop 1

Would be good to introduce Figma to the cohort before this...or you could have a short video explainer for how you could do certain things in figma.

- Let the cohort spend the entirety of this session building a clickable figma prototype

- Send a link to the Figma prototype to the product owners and ask them to add comments about elements they would like changed on miro

- Introduce the idea of creating a video pitch to the product owners to convince the devs to work on their idea. It might be worth having a separate video that explains what they could put into a video. e.g. What would the MVP be? Why should the devs work with them? What have they learnt from the programme? Where do they see the product heading next, if it is not selected?
