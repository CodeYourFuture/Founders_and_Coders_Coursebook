# Figma Workshop 1

Would be good to introduce Figma to the cohort before this...or you could have a short video explainer for how you could do certain things in figma.

- Let the cohort spend the entirety of this session building a clickable figma prototype

- Send a link to the Figma prototype to the product owners and ask them to add comments about elements they would like changed on miro

- Introduce the idea of creating a video pitch to the product owners to convince the devs to work on their idea.
