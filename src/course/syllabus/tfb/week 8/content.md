# Product Refinement

## What will we be doing in this session?

In this session you will spend 90 minutes refining your figma prototypes using the usability testing from the last week.

- **Remember** you do not have to take on-board all the feedback that you got.


## Traffic light & Rainbow analysis

To help you think about the kinds of questions to ask your users when creating your scripts it is important to understand the analysis process looks.

**Traffic light analysis**

During this analysis you create a spreadsheet or table with tasks you asked the users to complete as rows; and participants as columns. You can then mark whether the user:

- Completed the task
- Struggled with the task
- Did not complete the task

**Rainbow Analysis**

During this analysis you create a spreadsheet and list observations in rows, and participants in columns. Where an observation occurs, mark the cell, giving each participant a different colour.
