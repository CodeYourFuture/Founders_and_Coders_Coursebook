## Checking our code

What are all the different ways to make sure our code is correct?

### Questions to consider

1. What is Prettier? How might it help us write better code?
1. What is static analysis? How can a linter help us avoid bugs?
1. What are the pros and cons of unit, integration and end-to-end tests?

### Questions to consider

1. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)? Can it help us write better code?
1. What is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)? How do we translate user requirements into automated tests?
1. What is test coverage? Can this tell us about the _quality_ of our tests?
