In this Wednesday's session we discussed solutions to last week's [unit testing workshop](/workshops/learn-unit-testing).

## Integration testing

_90 minutes_

Practice writing [integration tests](/workshops/learn-integration-testing/) for more realistic code that uses the DOM.

<!--

## Tech Spikes

_90 minutes_

Complete the two [Tech Spikes](../spikes/) on "checking your code" and "testing methodologies".

## Project

_90 minutes_

Create the GitHub repo, then write the user story issues and accompanying tests for [this week's project](../project/). The tests should fail for now (since you haven't written any code yet), but getting all the structure in place will help you when you start actually building the project next week. -->
