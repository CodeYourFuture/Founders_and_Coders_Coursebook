In this Wednesday's session we started the [TDD array methods workshop](/workshops/tdd-array-methods/).

## TDD Array Methods

_60 minutes_

Try to implement some more of the array methods in this workshop. Don't worry if you don't have time to finish them all.

## Project

_120 minutes_

Finish writing your [To-do project](../project/). You should already have failing tests writtenâ€”now is the time to write the code to make those tests pass.
