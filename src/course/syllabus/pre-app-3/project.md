Your project for these two weeks is to build a _Projects Gallery_ using what you've learnt. The gallery should have an image of the project, a title and a short description.

Create an `index.html` in your existing learnings repo on GitHub. You can create the gallery in here, with links to all the projects in the repo, and then deploy the repo to GitHub Pages.

**This week:** Refactor your code this week to include your learnings about CSS architecture, variables and responsive design.
