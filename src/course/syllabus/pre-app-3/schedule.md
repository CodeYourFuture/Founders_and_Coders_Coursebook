## Git and GitHub

Upload your learnings to your GitHub learning repository.

This week, focus on adding some reflections on:

- CSS Architecture
- Responsive Design
- Advanced CSS

## Spikes

During the course, each week you'll do [technical spikes](course/handbook/spikes) with members of other project teams.

This week, these three topics are your spikes. Each person should learn every topic and be able to talk about it, how you research them is up to you and we'd love to see you working together.

Visit the [spikes](../spikes) tab for some questions to consider and resources to help you.

## Project

The focus of the [project](../project) this week is to refactor your site with what you've learnt this week in mind.

Add reflections to your learnings repository on:

- How you found looking at code you'd written and refactoring
- Any challenges you encouter with updating the layout of a site to be responsive
