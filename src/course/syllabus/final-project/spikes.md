# Design Week Spikes

- Spikes will be held in your role groups
- Consult with your role mentor to decide on what you'll focus on
- Use this as an opportunity to read and explore documentation on a new technology or practice
- For example, QA's might look at Cypress, DevOps at AWS, UX/UI at Styled Components, and Scrums at techniques for time estimations
