## Learning Outcomes

You should be focusing on meeting these learning outcomes over the three-week period. You will be tested on your learning during weekly quizzes.

## Testing

- [ ] Check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output

- [ ] Write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions

- [ ] Design functions for common testing patterns, like checking for matches, equality or inequality

- [ ] Organise tests using descriptive names and groupings to clarify their purpose and outcomes

- [ ] Implement custom messages in test assertions to provide specific feedback for pass/fail outcomes
 
- [ ] Write modular, single-responsibility functions that are easy to test in isolation
