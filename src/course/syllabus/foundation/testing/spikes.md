## Testing methodologies

How do different testing methodologies try to improve the way we write tests?

### Questions to consider

1. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)? Can it help us write better code?
1. What is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)? How do we translate user requirements into automated tests?
1. What is test coverage? Can this tell us about the _quality_ of our tests?
