Your challenge for the next two weeks is to build an agency website for your team.

Your website should give potential clients:

- An introduction to your agency
- Information about each member of your team
- A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

## User Stories

_**A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.**_

### Core Stories

Together, you and your partner should decide who will lead on each user story. You may need to rely on each other for parts of the project. Try to split the work evenly between you both.

**As a potential client, I want to:**

- See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are (E1)
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (E3)
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage (E1)
- Contact you to enquire about working with you (E3)
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name (E1)

**Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:**

- Navigate your website using keyboard controls (E2)
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website (E1)

## Acceptance Criteria

_**User stories come with [acceptance criteria](https://blog.easyagile.com/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development-d4b25356b604?gi=dc603f56ed77) - a detailed scope of a user’s requirements.**_

- Navigation menu
- ‘About us’ section
- Contact form
- A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

### Stretch Goal

Use the automatic trigger functionality of your [GitHub project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).

Finally, feel free to get creative with the content of your website! Good luck!
