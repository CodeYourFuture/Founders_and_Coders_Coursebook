# Project Gallery

Your project this week is to build a responsive project gallery using flexbox!
You may want to use this gallery later on in your [application website](../../website/project) to showcase all the work you've done so far!

## Requirements

The project gallery should:

- [ ] Contain reusable project cards
- [ ] Each card should have a title, an image of your project, and a description
- [ ] Use Flexbox to arrange the cards on the page
- [ ] Resize appropriately based on screen width
- [ ] Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices
- [ ] Have a "Read More" button on each card that opens and closes the description text
  > Use your knowledge of JS functions, loops and DOM manipulation to implement this feature
