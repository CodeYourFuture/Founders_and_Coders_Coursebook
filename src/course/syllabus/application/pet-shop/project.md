For this project, we're giving you some data in a JavaScript object. Create an interface where the user can interact with and change what is displayed on your webpage. Interacting with the page will alter and update the data stored in the object.

What you build and how you interpret the data is up to you. We are looking to see your own way of displaying and interacting with the data.

## Requirements

- [ ] Store the object below in a JavaScript file in your codebase
- [ ] Render the data into HTML using DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Allow the user to update object values when interacting with the webpage

## Data

Your data is stored in the following object:

```
let dataObject = {
  1: {
    name: "Fido",
    type: "dog",
    nature: "playful",
    status: "available",
  },
  2: {
    name: "Benson",
    type: "cat",
    nature: "jittery",
    status: "homed",
  },
  3: {
    name: "Esio",
    type: "tortoise",
    nature: "excitable",
    status: "available",
  },
  4: {
    name: "Turbo",
    type: "tortoise",
    nature: "relaxed",
    status: "available",
  },
  5: {
    name: "Rufus",
    type: "naked mole-rat",
    nature: "playful",
    status: "available",
  },
};
```

For this project, we'd like you to get used to using Git from your terminal.

The terminal (sometimes known as the command line) is an interface you can use to navigate file structure, install software, and many other things. It can take a little while to get used to, but can prove much faster than using a GUI. If you're unfamiliar, we'd recommend having a look at [Josh W Comeau's introduction](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/).

The steps in using Git are the same you learn in [our first workshop](/workshops/git-intro) - however, we'd encourage you to follow through [our second workshop](/workshops/git-terminal) to get up to speed.
