## Comment Box User Interface

Your project this week is to build a "leave a comment" feature as seen on popular social media or news sites.

It should:

- [ ] Use html form elements
- [ ] Have inputs for a entering a name, email, and a comment
- [ ] Have a submit button
- [ ] Check whether the comment exceeds a character count of 140 characters using Javascript
- [ ] Display the number of characters as the user types (e.g. 87/140)
- [ ] Give user feedback with custom styling on the comment box, when the user exceeds the character limit (e.g. with a coloured border)
- [ ] Show the comments on the page once they have been submitted (note: we do not expect them to stay on the page when you refresh)

For this project, we'd like you to get used to using Git from your terminal.

The terminal (sometimes known as the command line) is an interface you can use to navigate file structure, install software, and many other things. It can take a little while to get used to, but can prove much faster than using a GUI. If you're unfamiliar, we'd recommend having a look at [Josh W Comeau's introduction](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/).

The steps in using Git are the same you learn in [our first workshop](/workshops/applicant-git-1) - however, we'd encourage you to follow through [our second workshop](/workshops/applicant-git-2) to get up to speed.
