Your project is to build a comment form for a website. The form will allow a user to enter their name, email and a short comment. When they submit the form, the page should then show the comment in a section alongside the author's name.

## Requirements

- [ ] Use HTML form elements
- [ ] Have inputs for a entering a name, email, and a comment
- [ ] Have a submit button
- [ ] Check whether the comment exceeds a character count of 140 characters using Javascript
- [ ] Display the number of characters as the user types (e.g. 87/140)
- [ ] Give user feedback with custom styling on the comment box, when the user exceeds the character limit (e.g. with a coloured border)
- [ ] Show the comment on the page when submitted

{% box %}

We do not expect the comments to stay on the page when you refresh

{% endbox %}
