Your final project is to build a website showcasing your application. Your website should:

- Tell us about you
- Talk about why you'd like to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what you've learnt so far

We welcome creativity within your implementation, this is your opportunity to show off with a website about you!

## Requirements

Your website must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] All code is written by you
- [ ] No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React or GitHub Pages themes, but external fonts/icons are fine)
- [ ] Tells us about who you are
- [ ] Tells us about why you are applying for the programme
- [ ] Hosted on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
- [ ] Shows your progress through the application projects (e.g. links to repos, as a project gallery, or in an image carousel)

To demonstrate your learning your site must have at least one example of each of these:

- [ ] Semantic HTML5 elements
- [ ] CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
- [ ] DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
- [ ] DOM updates in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)
