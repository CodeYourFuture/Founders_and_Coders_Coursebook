Your first project is to create a _Hobby Page_. This can be about one of your hobbies, a particular interest of yours, or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript.

If you're new to web development, we recommend you check out the [resources](../resources) before you get started. You might like to spend some time learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS before you dive in. You don't need to know a lot about JavaScript to complete this project and our projects intend to guide your learning through it. Before starting the project, have a read through our [guide to getting started](/course/getting-started/).

## Requirements

- [ ] The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about
- [ ] The page has a logical layout and clear structure
- [ ] There are images on the page, with [alt-text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) where appropriate
- [ ] The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours
- [ ] A list is visible somewhere on the page
- [ ] Everything on the page fits on any screen size, without content overflowing or being cut off
- [ ] A user can click on a link that takes them to another website
- [ ] The page has a header element, and a footer element
- [ ] Somewhere on the page, the user can see today's date. The date should always be correct. You'll need to use JavaScript to generate the date, and DOM manipulation to display it.

Your code should be in a remote repository on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and your site deployed live with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you're new to using Git and GitHub, we recommend following [our tutorial](/workshops/git-intro/) to get started.
