# Fruit Shop

Your Project this week is to build a fruit shop app that lists produce and allows a user to create a shopping basket!

{% box %}
For this project, we also expect you to research how to use git from the command line, instead of using the source control tab on VS code.

If you have not used the terminal/command line before - it's also a good idea to do some research on navigating your file system using the terminal, and using commands like `cd`, `ls`and `touch`/`echo`
{% endbox %}

The Fruit shop must:

- [ ] Display Produce as cards - you might want to reuse code from your projects gallery
- [ ] Have a working "add to cart" button for each fruit
- [ ] Store the user's basket as a javascript object
- [ ] Display the basket on the side of the page, with an "empty" message to start.
- [ ] Display the number of fruits in the basket with icons and numbers
- [ ] Have "+","-",and "x" buttons to add one, remove one, and remove all instances of a fruit from the basket.
- [ ] Show a total number of fruits in the basket
