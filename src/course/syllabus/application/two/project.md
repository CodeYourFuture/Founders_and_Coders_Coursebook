# Project Gallery

Your project this week is to build a responsive project gallery using flexbox!
You may want to use this gallery later on in your [application website](../six/project.md) to showcase all the work you've done so far!

## Requirements

The project gallery should:

- [ ] Contain reusable project cards built with html, with an image/screenshot of your project, a title, and a description
- [ ] Use flexbox to arrange the cards on the page
- [ ] Resize appropriately based on screen width.
- [ ] Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices
- [ ] Have a "Read More" button on each card that opens and closes the description text - use your knowledge of JS functions, DOM manipulation and loops to implement this feature
