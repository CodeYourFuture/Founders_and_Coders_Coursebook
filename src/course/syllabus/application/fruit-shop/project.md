# Fruit Shop

Your project is to build a fruit shop that lists fruits and allows a user to create a shopping basket!

The fruit shop must:

- [ ] Display fruits available for purchase
- [ ] Have a working _add to basket_ button for each fruit
- [ ] Store the user's basket as a javascript object
- [ ] Increment or decrement the object values when fruits are added or removed
- [ ] Use reusable functions to complete repeatable tasks
- [ ] Have buttons to add one, remove one, and remove all instances of a fruit in the basket
- [ ] Display the basket as empty if all object values are zero
- [ ] Display the quantity of each fruit in the basket, when there is at least one of any fruit
- [ ] Show a total number of fruits in the basket
