## Comment box UI

Your project this week is to build a "leave a comment" feature as seen on popular social media or news sites.

It should:

- [ ] Use html form elements
- [ ] Have inputs for a entering a name, email, and a comment
- [ ] Have a submit button
- [ ] Check whether inputs are empty or invalid(in the case of email) when submitting.
- [ ] Use custom styles - borders on the input, and an error text underneath the input to give user feedback
- [ ] Show the comments on the page once they have been submitted (note: we do not expect them to stay on the page when you refresh)
