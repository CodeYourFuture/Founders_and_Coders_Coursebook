## Comment box UI

Your project this week is to build a "leave a comment" feature as seen on popular social media or news sites.

It should:

- [ ] Use html form elements
- [ ] Have inputs for a entering a name, email, and a comment
- [ ] Have a submit button
- [ ] Check whether the comment exceeds a character count of 140 characters using Javascript
- [ ] Display the number of characters used (eg 87/140). This should increment as the user types
- [ ] Use custom styles - borders on the input, and an error text underneath the input(s) to give user feedback
- [ ] Show the comments on the page once they have been submitted (note: we do not expect them to stay on the page when you refresh)
