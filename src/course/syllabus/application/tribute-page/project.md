Your first project is to create a _Tribute Page_. This can be about an interest of yours or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript.

If you're new to web development, we recommend you check out the [resources](./resources.md) before you get started. You might like to spend some time learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS before you dive in. You don't need to know a lot about JavaScript to complete this project and should be a good introduction to the language.

## Requirements

1. The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about
1. The page has a logical layout and clear structure
1. The user can view the date in a footer, which is rendered in JavaScript
1. There are images on the page, with [alt-text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) where appropriate
1. The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours
1. A list is visible somewhere on the page
1. Everything on the page fits on any screen size, without content overflowing or being cut off
1. A user can click on a link that takes them to another website
1. Somewhere on the page, the user can see today's date
   > Note: the date should always be correct. You'll need to use JavaScript to calculate it, and DOM manipulation to display it.
1. The page has a header element, and a footer element
