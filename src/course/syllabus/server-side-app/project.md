Your project this week is to build anything you like as long as it meets the technical criteria below. It should still be a Node/Express server-rendered application with a Postgres database, but feel free to get creative with the ideas.

This week is the culmination of your Express learning, so focus on doing everything as professionally as you can. Your app should have validation, error-handling, good user-experience etc.

## Technical spikes

Your project should include one of these four new topics. You'll have to spend some time researching them in your group, figuring out how exactly to implement them before you start working on your project. There are minimal examples provided, but they are only one way to approach itâ€”feel free to find tutorials/blog posts etc with alternative solutions.
