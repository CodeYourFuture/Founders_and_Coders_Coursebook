Your project for this week is to continue working on your [digital agency website](../../pre-app-4/project).

One of you will add a way to get in touch if a client is interested in working with you. When the user clicks submit on the form, their request should be added to a visible backlog on the page. The backlog does not need to be preserved when the user refreshes the page.

The other will add an option to add a member to the team. There should be an 'admin password' that must be entered in order to validate that the request to add someone is from a verified member of the team. The profile does not need to be preserved when the user refreshes the page.

Use what you've learnt in this week's DOM workshops to code an efficient and robust solution.

Your requests section should:

- Allow users to leave comments requesting to work with your agency
- Attach a visible user name to each request
- Ask the user to give an email address and validate the email
- Limit the length of requests to 149 characters

Your add a member section should:

- Allow administrators to add new members to the digital team
- Have a name, description and image to represent the team member
- Validate that the request has come from a member of the team
- Limit the length of requests to 149 characters

## User Stories

_**A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.**_

### Core Stories

Together, you and your partner should decide who will lead on each user story. You may need to rely on each other for parts of the project. Split the work evenly between you both.

We have estimated each user story to give you a rough idea of how long it might take. We are assuming each developer's velocity for this sprint is 10 story points. Use your velocity from last week to estimate how many points you will complete this week.

For more information and definitions of these terms, see our [project management page](/course/handbook/project-management).
