This week you'll be building an e-commerce shopping site for a fake brand. It doesn't need to actually take payments or have a checkout, but it should have product listings and the ability to add items to a shopping basket.

You'll be provided with a Postgres database hosted on AWS RDS, so you don't have to worry about that. You can take the database URL and run any SQL you like to create your tables etc.

## Acceptance criteria

- Server-rendered with Next.js
- Hosted on Vercel
- Data stored in AWS Postgres
- Homepage with product listings
- Individual product pages, containing:
  - Quantity/colour/variant pickers
  - "Add to basket" button
- Basket page showing all items being purchased
  - Basket contents saved for future visits

## Stretch criteria

- Filter products by category
- Sort products by price
- "Featured" products on homepage
