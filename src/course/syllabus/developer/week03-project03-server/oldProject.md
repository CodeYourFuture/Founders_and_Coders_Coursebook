# The Amazin' Quizzer App

## Intro

Learners will develop an web application that dynamically generates quizzes. These app should have interfaces both for quiz creation and quiz taking. You can use a AI tool to generate questions or use the ones provided and should use a JSON object in a separate file as a mock database. 

## Project

Your project for this week will be to develop a RESTful api as the backend of your application.

## Spike

Before you start writing features you need to design the schema for your data and RESTful API. Think about what different data your app needs to store and how you will access that data using your endpoints. Record your schema and endpoints in your `README.md` to make it easy for other developers to quickly get started using your API. 

### User Stories

As a **quizzer**, I want to:

- Select a subject area for my quiz.
- Begin a quiz session with randomly generated questions.
- View a summary of my quiz results, including areas of strength and weakness.
- Add, edit, and delete quiz questions and answers.

## Repository naming convention
Please name your repo following this template:
PRO03_Name1_Name2_Name3_Name4

### Acceptance Criteria

**The API should:**

- [ ] Dynamically generate quizzes with adaptive difficulty.
- [ ] Filter quiz questions by category.
- [ ] Return any number of questions by the above criteria.
- [ ] Add or delete questions from the 'database'.
- [ ] Provide good documentation on the use of the API.

### Stretch
- [ ] Implement a favourite count on questions and allow filtering by this criterion.
