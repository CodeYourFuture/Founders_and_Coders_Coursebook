## Learning Outcomes

- Develop a server using Express and TypeScript for backend applications (K9, S1, S11, S12)
- Identify the server's role within a full stack application (K1, K2, K3)
- Understand the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript, such as improved code quality, enhanced developer productivity, and better tooling support (K7, S1)
- Learn the basic syntax and features of TypeScript (S1, S16)
- Gain experience in using developer tooling, including IDEs, linters, and formatters, to enhance productivity (B3, B9)
- Grasp the concept and purpose of RESTful APIs (K11, S12)
- Construct and implement RESTful APIs effectively (S1, S11, S12, S16)
- Determine appropriate scenarios for applying RESTful APIs (K7, S9, B2)
- Design endpoint structures for data creation, modification, and deletion (K11, S8, S12)
- Utilize `node:fs` for filesystem operations (S1, S16)
- Gain experience in documenting the application's architecture, API endpoints, and user guides for future reference and maintenance (S15, B4, B7, B8)
- Utilize Postman to test RESTful APIs independently of frontend components, ensuring proper functionality, error handling, and adherence to API specifications (S5, S6, S7)
