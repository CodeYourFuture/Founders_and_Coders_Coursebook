Your project this week is TBC

## Intro

Learners will develop an end-to-end dynamic e-commerce web application where users can browse and purchase products online. 

The application will be built using React. For the backend, it will use Node.js and Express to handle server-side functionality and data persistence. User accounts and product data will be stored in a SQLite database.

## Project

Your project for this week will be to develop a SQLite database linked to a react app with methods that can search for items display information and add to a shppping cart.


## Spikes

## Spike

Before you start writing features you need to design the schema for your data. Think about what different things your app needs to store, how they relate to each other, and how you can avoid duplicating information. Record your schema in your `README.md` using Markdown tables. Consider embedding a [diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/) to help visualise the relationships.

### Questions to consider

1. What kinds of data relationships are there?
2. What’s a foreign key? How can they help us design schemas with relational data?
