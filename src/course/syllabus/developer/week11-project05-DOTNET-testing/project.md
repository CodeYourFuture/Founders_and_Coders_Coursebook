Your task this week is to continue building the project from last week but to try and add some .NET tests and more broadly to use dependency injection.

## Spike

Before you start think what are your dependencies. Which of these are tightly tied to other classes in a way that will slow development or make testing hard. If you want to replace this with dependency injection think what will the interface look like.

### Questions to consider

- What do you want the structure of your project to look like and how should the solution file be configured to allow that?
- Where do you want to use dependency injections in my code?
- How will you test the functionality of the API?
- Where you are using interfaces what keys and methods will the interface need to look for?


### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tests for all the functions of your APIs

 - [ ] Tests run without making changes to the actual database

 - [ ] Code is efficiently organized and has been refactored

### Stretch criteria

- [ ] Add verification to your code and test its functionality
