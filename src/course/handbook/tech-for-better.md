# Tech for Better Project

## Introduction

Tech for Better(TfB) is a programme for entrepreneurs, charities and early start-ups to plan and manage the process of building a digital product as Product Owners. This is achieved by working alongside software developers on the Founders and Coders full-time apprenticeship course.

There is a single TfB session held during each of the first 9 weeks of the course, as outlined below. Software developers then focus full-time on Tech for Better during the last 3 weeks of the course. Grouped into Product Teams, they work in partnership with one Product Owner to deliver an MVP\* for a real-life product idea.

\*An ["MVP"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), or Minimum Viable Product, is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

## Schedule

#### [Week 1](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/server/schedule/) - [Introduction](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/dev-intro/#0)

A session held with software developers only, introducing the Tech for Better(TfB) programme, reviewing the TfB schedule, and introducing the role of Product Owner(PO).

#### [Week 2](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/database/schedule/) - [Product Pitches](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/pitches/#0)

The Product Owners(POs) meet with the software developers in groups and introduce their own idea for a digital product. By the end of the session all developers will have an initial understanding of who each PO's user group is, the problem that the user group is facing, and how a digital product will benefit them.

#### [Week 3](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/authentication/schedule/) / [Week 4](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/server-side-app/schedule/) - [Discovery Workshops](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/discovery/#0)

The Discovery Workshop is repeated, with half the Product Owners attending each week. This allows more developers to explore each product, including the user group it supports and the problem that it seeks to address.

For each product, the PO and a group of software developers define a Problem Statement that answers who the products users are, what they need, and how responding to their need will benefit them. They then create user personas, before writing up questions that form the basis of user interviews to be conducted in week 5.

#### [Week 5](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/client-side-app/schedule/) - User Research (Product Owners Only)

Product Owners conduct user interviews independently during week 5, using the questions from week 3 and 4 as a basis.

There is no TfB scheduled for software developers in week 5. Instead, the software developers look ahead to their seperate [In-house project](), discussing project ideas as a group and confirming their individual preferences.

#### [Week 6](../../syllabus/apprenticeship/full-stack-app/schedule/) - [Research Synthesis](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/research-analysis/#0)??

<!-- Rename slides to Research Synthesis for clarity? -->

For each product, a group of developers and the PO write notes on what came out of the research from week 5, before theming the notes and writing insight statements to summarise them. At the end of the session the groups think about any further research to conduct.

#### [Week 7](../../syllabus/projects/in-house-design/schedule/) - [Product Management](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/product-management/#0)

#### [Week 8](../../syllabus/projects/in-house-build-1/schedule/) - Selection (Software Developers only)

Software developers review all Tech for Better Product ideas as a group and shortlist by confirming their individual preferences.

#### [Week 9](../../syllabus/projects/in-house-build-2/schedule/) - [Analysis Workshop](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/analysis/#0)

Following the shorlisting and selection of products in weeks 8, Product Owners work with their assigned Product Team (software developers) to take a closer look at their product idea.

Together they plan the main path through their application - considering how users will find their service, how users will learn what the service offers and how to use it, as well as what steps users will take when using the app.

The PO and Product Team also think about building a product which will respond to the user needs, and consider the intended and unintended consequences of their product.

#### [Week 10](../../syllabus/projects/tfb-design/schedule/) - TfB Design Week

During the first half of TfB Design Week, the Product Team (software developers) work alongside their own Product Owner(PO) to define their MVP. Sessions include:

**[Definition Workshop](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/definition/#0):** Product Teams and PO search for inspiration from other sources before generating their own ideas and creating low fidelity wireframes.

**[Wireframing](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/#types-of-wireframes):** Product Teams work together to create a high fildelity prototype of their app, refining it following feedback from there PO and end users.

**[User Testing](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/ut-synthesis/#0):** Product Teams conduct user testing with real users scheduled by their PO, using their high fidelity protoype.

During the second part of the week, the Product Teams turn their attention to the technical apsects of their product. Sessions include:

**[Code Planning](https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/code-planning/#0):** This in two parts. During Service Blueprinting the Product Teams identify points of interation between users and their app, and document what should happen in the back end. During Teck Stacks, the Product Teams then identify potential technical options for their project's requirements.

**[Technical Spikes](../../syllabus/projects/TFB-design/spikes/):** Product Teams read and explore documentation on technologies that might be used for their project, or to find a definitive answer for some of the "How might we" questions that came up during the Definition Workshop.

#### [Week 11](../../syllabus/projects/tfb-build-1/schedule/) / [Week 12](../../syllabus/projects/tfb-build-2/schedule/) - TfB Build Week 1 / TfB Build Week 2

Product Teams build their MVP across two build weeks, in partnership with their Product Owners. Each Product Team is also supported through check-in calls and code reviews with volunteer Project Mentors from apprentice employers and FAC alumni.

At the end of Build Week 2, the Product Teams and PO's present their products to local leaders in the social tech sector and alumni from Founders and Coders at the Tech for Better Showcase.
