# Safeguarding policy

This policy describes our approach to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of vulnerable adults. It applies to all of our work with learners (both apprentices and not), and includes our permanent core team and any part-time or volunteer contributors.

## What safeguarding is

Safeguarding is protecting children, young people and adults at risk from abuse and neglect. It means protecting the physical and mental health of children, young people and adults at risk. Effective safeguarding should allow children, young people and adults at risk to get the best outcomes in life.

_Founders and Coders is an adult-only programme, so the rest of this policy is focused on safeguarding adults specifically._

Safeguarding vulnerable adults is defined in the Care and support statutory guidance issued under the Care Act 2014 as:

- protecting the rights of adults to live in safety, free from abuse and neglect people and organisations working together to prevent and stop both the risks and experience of abuse or neglect
- people and organisations making sure that the adultâ€™s wellbeing is promoted including, where appropriate, taking fully into account their views, wishes, feelings and beliefs in deciding on any action
- recognising that adults sometimes have complex interpersonal relationships and may be ambivalent, unclear or unrealistic about their personal circumstances and therefore potential risks to their safety or well-being

## Why safeguarding is important

Having a robust safeguarding policy is important to ensure we do not miss signs of abuse or neglect. We want our programmes to be a safe place for people to learn, and this cannot happen unless everyone involved is vigilant in following safeguarding procedures.

## Prevent duty

As an apprentice training provider we have a duty to prevent our learners from becoming radicalised by extremist ideologies, or drawn into terrorist activity. The Government defines extremism as "vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and belief".

This is important as extremism is an ongoing threat to the UK. Anything we can do as an organisation to help prevent radicalisation can contribute to reducing this danger.

## Reporting concerns

We strive for our learners to both be and feel safe. Our core team understand safeguarding indicators and will respond proactively to any concerns that are raised.

Our Designated Safeguarding Officer is Dan Sofer and our Deputy DSO is Gregor Thomson.

If you have any safeguarding concerns regarding yourself or another learner please raise them using our [Safeguarding Concerns form](https://airtable.com/shr3X3AAoT8JJwyb7).
