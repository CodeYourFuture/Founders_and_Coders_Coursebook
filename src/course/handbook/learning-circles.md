# Learning circles

- Groups of 4, 90 minutes, with each learner leading the discussion for 20 minutes in turn;
- Facilitator: checkin/out; ensures no interruptions; and that the circle proceeds in rounds;
- Timekeeper: ensures nobody goes over time;
- Recorder: takes note of who was present and records each circle member's closing TIL. (Only needed if the circle is feeding back to a larger group);
- The circle starts by appointing a facilitator; they then do a check-in; the facilitator appoints a timekeeper and recorder; they then request the first person to present;
- The first person shares their screen, and either presents their work or the problem that they, or the group as a whole, wants to discuss;
- The circle then proceeds in rounds, with each learner taking it in turn to ask questions or respond to the material;
- The first round is for each learner to ask clarifying questions to ensure that they understand the material; this would normally proceed quite quickly with each learner asking one or at most two questions and any responses kept short;
- The second, longer round is the problem-solving round, where each learner in turn has an opportunity to respond to the material being presented, to make observations, or suggest solutions;
- only one person speaks at a time; as soon as the speaker has no more questions or no more observations or has solved the problem or after no more than 3-4 minutes has passed, they handover to the next person;
- The rounds may be more or less strictly adhered to, depending on the context, but it is important that all members of the circle have an opportunity to contribute and that the space is not dominated by one or two people; it is the responsibility of the whole group, not just the facilitator, to maintain the integrity of the circle;
- When the round comes to an end, the leader of the round can reflect on the round before handing over to the next circle member to share their screen;
- After every circle member has had an opportunity to lead the discussion, the facilitator does a TIL round where each person summarises their most important single learning from the circle; if feeding back to a larger group, the recorder can take note of each item and post the learnings in a designated place (e.g. a slack channel)
- Finally, the group checks out.

Note: for an inexperienced circle an external facilitator can take on all the roles.
