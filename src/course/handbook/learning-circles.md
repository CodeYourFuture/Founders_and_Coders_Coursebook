# Learning circles

## Set up
- Groups of 4. Typically, lasting 90 minutes, with four 20-minute rounds;
- Start with a check-in and end with a check-out;
- Inexperienced groups should have a facilitator present.

## Roles

- Proposer: presents a problem;
- Questioner: asks questions of the proposer;
- Responder: proposes solutions to the proposer;
- Observer: reflects on the problem and the responses of the group.

## Rounds

- The proposer shares their screen and presents the problem that they want to discuss;
- The questioner then proceeds solely by asking questions of the proposer with a view to the whole group gaining a better undertanding of the problem;
- If after 5 minutes or so and solely through the proposer's responses to questioning, the group has not yet gained an adequate understanding of the problem, it is the responder's role to try to navigate the proposer to a solution to the problem by more direct means; 
- After about 15 minutes, it is the observer's role to reflect on the problem and on the behaviour of the group;
- If there is a facilitator present, they can add their own reflections on whether the problem was at a suitable level, whether the group as a whole was supportive of each other, whether each participant stayed in role, and on the solution. They should also make sure the group is on schedule. If there is no facilitator present, this role can be taken by the observer;
- When the round comes to an end, each group member takes on a new role and the process is repeated until each member of the group has played all four roles.

Aims:
1. To give each participant an opportunity to get the support of the group with a problem that they are working on;
2. To give each participant practice in developing questioning strategies to aid problem solving;
3. To give each participant practice at communicating proposed solutions;
4. To give each participant practice at thinking reflectively about their learning processes;
5. To ensure that each participant gets an equal opportunity to develop their problem-solving skills;
6. To develop the capacity of all participants to run a strucutured study group without a facilitator present.

## Tools

- Question crib sheet, that the questioner can use as a scaffold for their questioning;
- Glossary of terms.
