# Pair programming

## Learning Outcomes

- Feel more comfortable with pairing
- Understand the benefits of pairing

## Task

1. You and your partner will work from one screen together
2. Choose a 8kyu kata on codewars, preferably one that neither of you have completed before
3. Read through the pair programming method below
4. Attempt the kata, using this pair programming method.
   - Pair for up to 30 minutes
   - Swap roles after 15 minutes
   - If in doubt, follow the coding questions [crib sheet](#coding-questions-crib-sheet)

Don't worry if you don't finish the kata. The aim is to learn the process. 15 minutes before the end, we will come together and discuss how you found it.

## Method

**Ping pong.** Take turns writing code. How much code you write depends on the context. Maybe, one developer writes a line of code and then the other writes a line of code. In another case, one developer starts by creating a single failing test and then each developer takes it in turns to first write code to make the test pass and then to write a new failing test before passing the keyboard back to their partner.

**The back-seat driver.** One developer shares their screen and follows the instructions of the other developer. The person 'driving' is the one typing and should follow exactly the instructions of the 'navigator'. If the navigator is lost and would like a suggestion, they can ask the driver where they think to go next or suggest somewhere to look online for a solution.

## Coding questions crib sheet

### Functions

- When defining a new function, are we using sensible names?
- Is it obvious at first glance what the procedure is for?
- What are the inputs for the function?
- And are these inputs reflected in the arguments?
- What do you expect the function return value to be?

### Variables

- Are you using sensible names for all your variables?
- Is it obvious at first glance what each of them is being used for?
- As you work through the problem, are you working from the outside in or are you trying to solve the problem in a linear sequence from top to bottom? (try working from the outside in, always thinking about the inputs and outputs of the code block you are working on)

### Tests

- What's a sensible first test for a function?
- Is this the simplest possible test that you can think of?
- As you work through the problem, are all your passing tests still passing? If not, why not?
- Are you adding tests as you go?
- What test are you going to add next?
