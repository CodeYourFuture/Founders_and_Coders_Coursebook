# What to expect from your mentors

Most of the mentors you will interact with on the course have recently graduated from the course. Some mentors will be alumni who finished the course a little while ago.

The types of mentors you'll meet are:

- Week mentors
- Pastoral care mentors
- Project mentors

## Week mentors

For the first 6 weeks of the course, there will be two weekly mentors in each week. These are members of the cohort immediately prior to yours.

Each week, they'll join your cohort workshop discussions and support you during your projects. These mentors are familiar with the curriculum as they've recently completed it. They won't always give you the answer but will help you get there. They may advise you on ways to debug your code, talk about the challenges they had on the course, or give advice on how to get the most out of the course.

## Pastoral care mentors

These mentors are here to give you guidance and advice throughout the course. You'll meet with your pastoral care mentor four times throughout the course. Aside from these times, you are always welcome to reach out to your pastoral care mentor if you have questions or are struggling on the course. We don't expect pastoral carers to provide mental health support.

## Project mentors

These mentors will support you throughout your final project(s). They may be FAC alumni, or from your apprenticeship employers.

They will give you technical advice on things like tech stack choices, recommended libraries, etc.

Project mentors are not expected to help with debugging day-to-day errors - instead you should use more immediately available resources including StackOverflow/Google, the other members of your cohort (`#help-and-solutions`) and our wider fac community (`#facoverflow`)

Your team should schedule specific slots to talk with project mentors.

These mentors will support you with planning and managing the project, but are usually volunteering outside their work commitmments, so you are responsible for reaching out to them and scheduling specific time slots that work for them, and for you.

You may want to use these meetings as checkpoints to discuss progress, and talk through anything that is particularly challenging for the team.

Reach out early and be clear about when and why you need support.
