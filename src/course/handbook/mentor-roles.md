# What to expect from your mentors

Most of the mentors you will interact with on the course have recently graduated from the course. Some mentors will be alumni who finished the course a little while ago.

The types of mentors you'll meet are:

- Week mentors
- Pastoral care mentors
- Project mentors
- Role mentors

## Week mentors

For the first 8 weeks of the course, there will be two weekly mentors in each week. These are members of the cohort immediately prior to yours. 

Each week, they shall guide you through workshops and support you during your projects. These mentors are familiar with the curriculum as they've recently completed it. They won't always give you the answer but will help you get there. They may advise you on ways to debug your code, talk about the challenges they had on the course, or give advice on how to get the most out of the course.

## Pastoral care mentors

These mentors are here to give you guidance and advice throughout the course. You'll meet with your pastoral care mentor four times throughout the course. Aside from these times, you are always welcome to reach out to your pastoral care mentor if you have questions or are struggling on the course. We don't expect pastoral carers to provide mental health support.

## Project mentors

These mentors will support you throughout your final project(s). They will give you technical advice, code review your code and support you with planning and managing the project. You are responsible for reaching out to them and asking for their support. 

These mentors will have completed the course, it may have been recently or may have been a longer time ago.

These mentors will be working and may not always be available, reach out early and be clear about when you may need their help.

## Role mentors

These mentors will support you throughout your final project(s). They will support you and others who have the same role in the project as you do. They will provide specialised support in fulfilling your role responsibilities.  You are responsible for reaching out to them and asking for their support. 

These mentors will have completed the course, it may have been recently or may have been a longer time ago.

These mentors will be working and may not always be available, reach out early and be clear about when you may need their help.
