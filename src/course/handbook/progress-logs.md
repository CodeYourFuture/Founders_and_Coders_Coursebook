# Progress Logs

During this training, apprentices will all be required to fill in a progress log. The template for this can be found in your cohort's GitHub organisation.

The purpose of the progress log is to enable apprentices to reflect on their learning week by week, identify strengths and areas for development, and to receive feedback on their progress from the Course Facilitators in order to improve.

This progress log must be updated every Friday as a reflection activity on the previous week's learning outcomes and ready for review by Monday morning.
