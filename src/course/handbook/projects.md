# Projects

Each week, you will be split into teams for weekly projects. These teams will be change throughout the course, giving you a chance to work with every other member of your cohort.

The Founders and Coders learning environment is all about collaboration, and this is a great opportunity to practise your workflow in a development team.

Project teams for each week are posted in your cohort repo, under the pairs-and-teams folder.

Remember to read each other's user manuals when you start working with a new team!

**Please do not work on your projects outside of course time**

This puts extra stress on everyone else. Remember that you are not expected to have a finished, polished project. It's about the learning journey, not the final outcome.

If you have the spare time and energy to code outside the course, focus on reviewing workshops or building side projects.

### Project Setup

Utilize your project setup time to do the following:

- Name your GitHub repo in the format

  `week#-<topic>-<team members' names or initials>`

  for example:

  `week2-database-reuben-gregor-oli-dan`

- Decide on key user stories and finalise the end goal for the project
- Create a set of GitHub issue labels to make it easier to plan your sprints
- Split up the user stories into issues, and assign your first day's work.
- Create a GitHub project board. The simplest structure for this is three columns of to-do, in progress and done.
- - From week 2, decide who takes on each [project role](../project-team/)

### Team workflow

- Pair program as much as possible - two brains are better than one, support each other!
- Decide how frequently you take breaks, and take them together!
- Don't always work on the same person's machine. Watching someone write code is very different to writing it yourself!
- Swap pairs every half-day. This means that you will break up work into more manageable chunks, but also that the team will work across different parts of the project, and with different people.
- Update your kanban board as you finish working on issues. Measuring your project velocity will be very beneficial during standups, so you can decide how to best use the remaining time in the sprint.
- Avoid focussing on a specific area too much (eg: if you're known as the CSS whiz, try not to find yourself single handedly fixing styling towards the end of the project). Challenge yourself, and pick tasks that make you uncomfortable!
