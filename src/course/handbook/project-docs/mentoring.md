# What makes a mentor?

Towards the end of your cohort, you'll have the opportunity to reflect with the rest of your cohort on the mentoring you've received. The goal of this reflection is to come up with ideas for what you'd like to take forward to mentoring the next cohort.

## The exercise

You'll have 75 minutes to reflect and share your thoughts together.

Spend the first 10 minutes thinking individually and writing a list of things you found were good qualities, or behaviours which you saw from your mentors.

You'll then split into small groups to come up with a shared list, building on your individual reflections.

After 15 minutes in your small groups, we'll come back as a cohort. Each group will take turns to share each reflection from their list.

Someone in the cohort can be nominated to take notes and add the document somewhere for you all to refer back to.

At the end of the session, we'll ask you to fill in an airtable form with your preferences on which week you'd like to mentor for the next cohort.

When you're mentoring the next cohort, you can refer back to your reflections to guide your mentoring.
