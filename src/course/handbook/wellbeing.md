## Pastoral Walks

Pastoral walks are designed to help you navigate through your learning journey with us. These are casual, one-on-one conversations with our course facilitators, where you can talk about your progress, any challenges you're facing, and give feedback to your CF.

#### What Happens During Pastoral Walks?

During these walks, your CF will:

- Listen to Your Concerns: Whether it's about your coursework, career goals, or personal challenges, they're here to help.
- Offer Guidance: They can provide advice on handling academic or professional challenges and help you navigate interpersonal issues.
- Answer Your Questions: Whether it's about the full-time program, employment preparation, or project expectations, they're a valuable resource.
- Avoid Direct Involvement in Conflicts: They'll help you approach and resolve conflicts, but won't get directly involved.

### Pastoral Walk Aims

### Foundation programme

- Discuss employment expectations
- Discuss any interpersonal challenges that have come up
- Identify future plans
- Ask questions about curriculum work (the structure and not the code)

### Apprenticeship

#### Recording Your Progress

After each pastoral walk, your CF will note down:

- Any agreed actions: Any advice or steps suggested, including follow-ups.
