# Platforms

## Replit

[Replit](https://replit.com) allows you to write and run code in the browser in an IDE (integrated development environment). You don't need to download anything to get this working. Log in with GitHub, choose a language, name your Repl, and start coding.

You can either choose _HTML, CSS, JS_ or _Node.js_ as your language when writing JavaScript. Your output will be displayed on the right hand side of the IDE.

## Stackblitz

[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) is an IDE which has a similar look and feel to VS Code. From here you can build websites and synchronise your code with a GitHub repository.

Stackblitz doesn't save your work automatically so remember to click Save in the top left after you write a chunk of code.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor widely used in Software Development. Using VS Code allows you to save your code to your local machine.

VS Code has numerous advantages such as source control, extentions, and keyboard shortcuts.
