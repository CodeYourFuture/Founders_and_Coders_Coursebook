## Build a feature

Create a project that uses user input and a timer - e.g. tortoise racer or image carousel

## Steps to build a feature

Plan it out
Break it down into steps
Write pseudocode
Test parts as you go

## The image carousel

This used to be a requirement
We want to give space for you to be creative
It touches on interesting things: having timed events, changing what is displayed on a page, responding to clicks and keyboard inputs

## The tortoise race

This uses similar features to the image carousel
Gives an introduction to timed events, moving elements across a page, responding to user input

## Build something you find exciting

We're looking for creative features that you have built yourself
Think about what you'd find interesting to build
Is there something you've always wanted to see on a website? A type of game you enjoy? Something that would add additional functionality to your site?

## Finding help

Looking up tutorials and following code you've seen written online is perfectly ok. However, it's important to make sure you understand the code.

Copy and pasting or following a tutorial without thinking about what the code is doing won't help your learning. When you're finding help elsewhere, make notes as you follow the tutorial and aim to rebuild the feature within your own skillset.

Change the code and observe the outputs, think about other ways to achieve the same effect, restructure the code so it makes sense to you.
