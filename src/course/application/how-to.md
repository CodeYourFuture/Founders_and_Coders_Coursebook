# How to...

Each week we'll post a set of prompts here for the community to work on. These will be inspired by the workshop topic from the week and during that workshop we'll touch on the main concepts you need to begin working on the weekly prompts. :seedling:

The purpose of the prompts is to get you thinking about coding and solving problems. As the weeks go on, you'll be able to build on your knowledge and understand how the different parts of building websites fit together. As we cover new material in workshops, you'll be able to practice with the prompts.

To work on the challenges for the first two weeks, we suggest using https://replit.com/. :robot: Make sure to save your code there and in a future workshop we'll show you how to upload those to GitHub.

If you have questions or are stuck on a prompt - ask in the relevant channels below. If you've learnt something interesting - share in #today-i-learned :sparkles: For just now, we won't ask you to share your solutions to the prompts or answers to bonus questions with the community but in the future we'll show you how you can share these and work together from the prompts. :two_women_holding_hands:
