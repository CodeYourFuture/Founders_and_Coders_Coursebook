# Approaching problems

When approaching coding problems, it can be helpful to follow a process. We recommend a four-step approach:

1. Understand the problem
1. Write Pseudocode
1. Write JavaScript
1. Refactor

## Understand the problem

First, make sure you understand the problem you're working on. What is it asking you to do? Look at the parts of the problem and break it down into manageable steps.

### Write Pseudocode

Break the problem down into key steps - each one should be one or two sentences.

Use JavaScript comments to write out these steps in order. Translate the problem into steps that you understand.

### Write JavaScript

Following your pseudocode, code each step. Translate the pseudocode into JavaScript.

### Refactor

Once you've coded a solution, reflect on what you wrote.

What can you change about your code to make it more efficient? How might you solve the problem differently?

## Tips

- Use `console.log()` often
- Re-read the problem
- Check your inputs and outputs
- Check for syntax errors
- Look at documentation such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- Read any error messages
