# Debugging

When writing code, we'll often run into problems and need to debug errors and bugs. Reading through our code and fixing problems is known as debugging.

## Dealing with errors

The first step in dealing with an error is always to read the error message. What is it telling you? Where is the error occurring in your code?

One you have a handle on what's going on, think about what might be causing it and how you can resolve the problem.

Changing one thing at a time is important when dealing with an error. Change something and observe whether the error stays or goes away. Changing multiple things at once might bring you further from resolving the problem and in a more difficult position than where you started. If you change something and still have the same problem, you'll probably need to change it back before trying something else.

As always, if in doubt, google the error. Read through others' experiences of finding this error and what caused it in their code.

Hitting errors is a common part of being a developer, learning to resolve them is half of being a developer.

## Writing readable code

good variable and function names that explain what they're for

break the code into manageable chunks

## Removing unnecessary code

duplicate CSS rules
comments
writing functions to complete repetitive tasks

## Refactoring

How can we make our code more efficient?
Is there a different way we can structure our code or write our syntax?
