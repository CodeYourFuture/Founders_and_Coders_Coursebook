## Flexbox

Flexbox allows us to create dynamic and responsive one-dimensional layouts.

## Axes

The flexbox layout positions elements across two axes: main and cross. Depending on the flex-direction of the container, elements will align in rows or columns.

## The flex container

To use flexbox, we contain the elements we'd like to lay out on the page within a container. The container's `display` property should be set to `flex`.

## Alignment and justification

Elements will be aligned and justified on the main and cross axes. We can use different values of the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to define our layout.

## Project Gallery

Create a project gallery which uses a flexbox layout. You'll need to add a container to keep each element and use properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap` to display the elements on the page.

Your project gallery could feature some of the websites you've built already while working through the application requirements.
