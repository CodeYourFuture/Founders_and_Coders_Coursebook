# Tribute page

Before you work on this assignment, we recommend you complete these two sections on freeCodeCamp:

- [Basic HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)
- [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/)

We'd like you to build a "tribute" website using HTML and CSS. This site should provide information about something you like or someone (public figure) you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal.

This will give you the opportunity to practice with HTML and CSS as well as demonstrate your learnings from freeCodeCamp so far.

You can create your site on [CodePen or on VS Code](../platforms) and push the site to [GitHub](../git).
