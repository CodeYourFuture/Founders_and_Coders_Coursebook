**Week 5: git and GitHub**

This week, you'll practise with **git flow**. Follow these steps to connect a local repository to a remote one on GitHub. Before following these steps, you'll need to install git:

:one: Create a folder on your computer and add files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. :books:

:two: Add some content to the HTML, link the CSS and add a script tag which points to your JS.

:three: Open up your terminal and navigate to the folder where you've saved your files. Initialise this folder as a git repository. :octopus:

:four: Stage and commit your changes.

:five: Create a remote repository on GitHub. The easiest way to set this up is without a README since GitHub will then give you instructions to connect with your local repository. :cloud: :computer:

:six: Connect your local and remote repositories. Push your changes from your local machine to the remote. :link:

:seven: Deploy your site to GitHub Pages. :zap:

Once you have a local and remote repository connected, you'll be able to keep both in sync by regularly staging, committing and pushing your changes to GitHub. Getting into the habit of doing this regularly will help you make sure your codebase is backed up and version-controlled. :seedling: :star2:
