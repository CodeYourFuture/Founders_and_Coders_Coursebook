# About our curriculum

Welcome to our curriculum. This material forms the basis of our tuition-free, peer-led web development programme.

Our curriculum is open source and free to use. This means anyone is welcome to work through the material at their own pace, even if they don't have a place on our full-time programme.

{% box %}

If you are planning on applying to our programme please do not complete workshops in advance. **We will not grant you a place on the course** if you have already worked through our curriculum.

{% endbox %}

If you do decide to use our material please let us know. We can only accept so many people onto our program so we'd love to hear about others benefiting from our work.

{% box "error" %}

If you do use our curriculum to self-learn please **do not claim to have attended or completed Founders and Coders**.
