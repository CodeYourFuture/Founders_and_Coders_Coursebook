@todo: write the workshop

This should be an opportunity to practice the Express basics learnt the day before.

Learning outcomes:

- creating GET & POST routes
- using built-in middleware to parse POST bodies
- redirecting after POSTs
- dynamic paths for created resources (`/post/1` etc)

Stretch outcomes:

- validating user-submitted data on the server
- redirecting to separate error page
- enhance that by storing errors on a cookie
- use cookie errors to show on the original form inline
