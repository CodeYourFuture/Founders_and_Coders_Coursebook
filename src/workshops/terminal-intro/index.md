This workshop is a brief introduction to using the terminal. This will allow you to create, move and modify folders and files without a GUI. Completing this workshop will open the possibility of using Git via your terminal rather than VS Code.

## Terminal

## Getting started

## Changing directories

## Creating a file

## Listing files

## Using Git

Now you've got a working understanding of the terminal, you're ready to start using Git via the terminal. You can learn more about that in our second [Git Workshop](../applicant-git-2/).
