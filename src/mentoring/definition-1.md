## Schedule

_We usually allocate a little longer than needed in the schedule to give time for running behind and having a break._

- 00:00 - [Synthesise Research](#synthesise-research)
- 00:40 - [Mapping](#mapping-the-journey)
- 01:00 - [How Might We...?](#how-might-we)
- 01:15 - End

## Synthesise research

The group will have separated for research, and now need to communicate their findings to one another.

We ask them to take three steps in doing this:

1.  Write down notes on what they heard from the research
1.  Organise those notes into themes
1.  Write up statements of the research insights

## Mapping the journey

This is a version of User Journey mapping. Developers should plan the main path through the application.

On the left hand side, they consider their user. And on the right, the goal of that user. These can both be lifted directly from the Problem Statement and don't need much thought. It's the product itself, the 'I need a way to...' that needs to be explored.

There's three main phases here:

- Discovery: finding the service
- Learning: Finding out what your service offers and how to use it
- Using: The regular steps the user will take when using the app
  _Discovery is the least important step for us on the programme. It's worth considering but not for more than a minute or two._

There might be a few different avenues, or choices made along the way. But by the end of the exercise, the team should have a broad idea of what the app will do and the order the user will perform actions in.

## How Might We...?

This is a speculative exercise which intends to get developers thinking about the challenges of building a Product which will respond to the needs they've identified so far. Asking questions, and not worrying about the answers, will help to shape the key challenges of building this product.
