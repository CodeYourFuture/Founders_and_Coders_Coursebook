# Week 3 Learning Outcomes

## Testing

- [ ] **We can test the functionality of our app**
- [ ] We can write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions
- [ ] We can check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output

### Modular functions

- [ ] **We can write testable, modular functions**
- [ ] We can write functions that add DOM nodes
- [ ] We can write functions that remove DOM nodes
- [ ] We can write functions that modify DOM nodes

### Event listeners

- [ ] **We can apply click event listeners to buttons**
- [ ] We can pass in named functions as the second argument

### Scope

- [ ] **We can apply the concept of ‘scoping’ to functions and variables**
- [ ] We can distinguish between block, function, and global scope so that we can control access to variables from different parts of our project

## Design

- [ ] **We can create a clean colour palette for our project**
- [ ] We can apply colours to HTML elements using CSS variables

---

## Developer Toolkit

- [ ] **We can run automated tests in the browser (to check that our client side code works correctly)**
- [ ] We can inspect the browser console to see the output of our tests
